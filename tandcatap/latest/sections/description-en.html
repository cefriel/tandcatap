Classes and properties not represented follow the recommendations and cardinalities provided by mobilityDCAT-AP. In the diagram, we highlighted in red the extensions introduced by mobilityDCAT-AP considering DCAT-AP, and in yellow the ones introduced by TangentDCAT-AP considering mobilityDCAT-AP.

TangentDCAT-AP fulfils the *mandatory* cardinalities defined by
mobilityDCAT-AP and the additional recommendations defined by
considering the specific TANGENT requirements. Each metadata field is serialized in RDF considering
the corresponding class and the associated properties (*adms:*
[http://www.w3.org/ns/adms#](http://www.w3.org/ns/adms#), *dcat:*
[http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#](http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#), *dct:*
<http://purl.org/dc/terms/>, *foaf:* <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> ,
*tandcatap:* <https://knowledge.c-innovationhub.com/tangent/tandcatap>).

Additional vocabularies adopted are defined in mobilityDCAT-AP:

-   [https://w3id.org/mobilitydcat-ap#](https://w3id.org/mobilitydcat-ap)
    (*mobilitydcatap:* prefix) defines the additional classes,
    properties and individuals introduced by mobilityDCAT-AP and usage
    notes according to the specification;

-   <https://w3id.org/mobilitydcat-ap/mobility-data-standard> controlled
    vocabulary for established standards used to represent mobility
    data, implemented as a SKOS Taxonomy.

Four *dcat:Catalog* individuals are defined by TangentDCAT-AP and are associated
with four individuals of class *tandcatap:CaseStudy* introduced to
univocally represent the TANGENT case studies (Athens, Lisbon, Greater
Manchester, Rennes Metropole). The *dct:publisher* of each
*dcat:Catalog* refers to the case study leader.

The list of metadata for a data source published in the catalogue is
represented as three interconnected individuals to fulfil the
cardinalities defined by mobilityDCAT-AP:
-   *dcat:CatalogRecord:* individual for metadata associated with the
    record describing a data source in the catalogue. A *dcat:Catalog*
    should be associated with one or more *dcat:CatalogRecord* using the
    *dcat:record* property (mandatory).
    -   *dct:created* and *dct:modified* (mandatory) represent the timestamp
        of creation and last modification of the data source;
    -   *adms:status* (mandatory) status of the record in the
        Data Catalogue. The dedicated controlled
        vocabulary *tanstatus:* is used to serialise the admissible
        values.
        -   Obligation raised to *mandatory* in TangentDCAT-AP due to
            the need for the TANGENT Management Board to assign a status to the data sources
            in the catalogue.
-   *dcat:Dataset:* individual for metadata associated with a data
    source in the catalogue. A dcat:Catalog is associated with a
    dcat:Dataset using the *dcat:dataset* property (*mandatory*). A
    *dcat:CatalogRecord* is associated with a *dcat:Dataset* using the
    *foaf:primaryTopic* property (mandatory).
    -   *dct:identifier* (mandatory): Identifier of the data source.
        -   Obligation raised to *mandatory* in TangentDCAT-AP due to the
            core role of identifiers in referencing and accessing the data
            sources.
    -   *dct:title* (mandatory): Name of the data source.
    -   *dct:description* (mandatory): Description of the data source.
    -   *tandcatap:caseStudy* (mandatory): Case study the data source is
        related to. The range of the property is the *tandcatap:caseStudy*
        class.
    -   *tandcatap:dataRequirement* (mandatory): One or more data
        requirement(s) covered by the data source. The dedicated controlled vocabulary
        *tandreq:* is used to serialise the admissible values.
        -   The *tandcatap:dataRequirement* property is defined as a
            subproperty of *mobilitydcatap:mobilityTheme,* and it can be
            used to satisfy its *mandatory* obligation. To better support
            the categorization of data sources adopted in TANGENT, we
            defined a subproperty to restrict the recommended range of
            values to the *tandreq:* vocabulary in TangentDCAT-AP.
    -   *dct:type* (recommended): Specify if the type of data in the data
        source is static, real-time or historical. The dedicated
        controlled vocabulary *tantype*: is used to serialise the admissible
        values.
    -   *dcat:theme* (recommended): Category/ies describing the data in the
        data source.
        -   The usage of the *mobilitydcatap:mobilityTheme* subproperty and
            the associated controlled vocabulary defined by mobilityDCAT-AP is recommended.
    -   *dct:publisher* (*mandatory* as in mobilityDCAT-AP): The
        user that provides the data source. The publisher should be
        modelled as an individual of class *foaf:Agent*, and described at
        least by an email address (*foaf:mbox* mandatory property).
    -   *dcat:spatial* (*mandatory* as in mobilityDCAT-AP): The
        geographical coverage of the data in the data source (e.g., group of
        streets, specific area, city, metropolitan area, region, national)
        as *dct:Location*.
    -   *dcat:spatialResolutionInMeters* (optional): The geographical
        aggregation of the data in the data source (e.g., kilometres,
        metres, etc.).
    -   *dcat:temporal* (recommended): The timeframe of the data in the data
        source (e.g., last year, 31st December 2020, 2017-2021, specific
        period, etc\...) as *dct:PeriodOfTime*.
    -   *dcat:temporalResolution* (optional): The temporal aggregation of
        the data in the data source (e.g., minutely, hourly, weekly,
        monthly, or event-based).
    -   *dct:accrualPeriodicity* (mandatory as in mobilityDCAT-AP): Describes how often the
        content of the data source is updated.
    -   *dct:source* (optional): Reference to the original data source(s)
        from which this data source is originated, e.g., as a result of a
        data fusion process.
-   *dcat:Distribution:* individual for metadata associated with the
    different distributions available to get access to a data source in
    the catalogue (e.g., different serialisation of a data source). A *dcat:Dataset* is associated with one or more *dcat:Distribution* using the *dcat:distribution* property (mandatory).
-   *dct:license* (mandatory): The terms for the access and usage of the
    distribution (e.g., open data, available only under agreement,
    released with specific licences).
    -   Raised to mandatory in TangentDCAT-AP to satisfy the obligation
        for the super-property *dct:rights* in mobilityDCAT-AP.
-   *mobilitydcatap:mobilityDataStandard* (mandatory): The data
    schema/model adopted to represent the data in the distribution
    (e.g., GTFS, NeTEx, Datex II, SIRI, etc). The dedicated controlled
    vocabulary *mobilitydcatap:mobility-data-standard* is used to
    serialise the admissible values.
    -   To comply with mobilityDCAT-AP, it is changed from
        *dct:conformsTo* to *mobilitydcatap:mobilityDataStandard* and
        the obligation is raised to *mandatory*.
    -   TangentDCAT-AP defines an additional admissible value for the
        *mobilitydcatap:mobility-data-standard* taxonomy to represent
        data harmonised according to the TANGENT Reference Conceptual
        Model (*tandcatap:* *TangentReferenceConceptualModel*).
-   *dct:format* (raised to *mandatory* as in mobilityDCAT-AP): The
    format used to encode the data in the distribution (e.g., XML, CSV,
    JSON). The vocabulary <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/file-type> is
    recommended to serialise the admissible values as defined in DCAT-AP.
-   *dcat:accessURL* (mandatory): URL redirecting to a web page or an
    endpoint to access the data.
    -   Following usage notes in mobilityDCAT-AP, this property can be
        used both for datasets and data services. Therefore, we removed
        from TangentDCAT-AP the distinction and the *mandatory*
        obligation associated with *dcat:endpointURL.*
-   *dcat:downloadURL* (optional): URL for the direct download of the
    distribution. It can coincide with the *dcat:accessURL*.
-   *adms:sample (*optional*)*: URL for the download of a sample of the
    distribution.
    -   Following the usage notes in mobilityDCAT-AP, this property can
        be used directly with a *dcat:Distribution* entity.
